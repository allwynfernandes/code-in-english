Inspired by the [Upgoer five](https://xkcd.com/1133/) this is an experiment in explaining programming in simple English words.
Time and again I have seen self taught programmers confess that their only regret is not having started sooner. I know this because I feel the same. 

The truth is that it wasn't difficult. It's just the fear I held at the time of all things Math/Numbers. 3 Years hence, I find that numbers account only for a fraction of my code. I wish someone had told me in those early years, using simple language to explain `Code in English`.

Of course this is a dumb way to learn code if you are already a Arc Linux, 10K SE, programming wizard, chances are you mind not find this blog very useful. Instead, if you are just starting out or haven't yet even considered yourself worthy of programming then this is the place to begin!

Another way to think of this blog could be as a medivial tale. If coding was a play, set in 100BC ha!
