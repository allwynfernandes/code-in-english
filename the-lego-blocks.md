## About this blog
#### What it is
An over simplification of programming concepts and tools such that it almost feels foolish NOT to learn programming.

#### What it isn't
A master handbook for programmers of mid to senior level comprable to Clean Code by Robert Martin or Code Complete by Steve McConnell. If you've read either of those two books, let me save you a lot of time and effort. Please bounce right away. This blog will either make your cry or laugh your ass off. Fair warning.

#### How to read it
Just as you would a comic book. Literally, the same attitude and seriousness.

#### The Seamor
[Seamor](/seamor.md) is your guy. He list's all those things that are too extensive or boring to mention on the main page. Everytime a concpet has some more stuff that's linked but not explained here, you can be sure to find it with [Seamor](/seamor.md)

# Let's go baby!
## Coding is like texting a buddy.
Progamming is like chatting with a very obedient, smart person. Whatever you ask them to do, they will do. If they can't (for whatever reason) they'll generally reply with a "sorry, no can do" along with some helpful excuses.

## Your cast of characters
#### Javascript is a monk
Javascript is a monk (or a famous non-fiction author). She writes, edits, elaborate books and documents(HTML) on specific request. You may take her help from time to time but not always.

#### HTML is a newspaper
HTML is a document itself. Like a book, bank statement, shopping reciept.

#### CSS is a fashion magazine
Think of CSS as a stone tablet like the 10 commandments. The great creator(You) has written a set of rules in it that prescribe what HTML should and should not wear, how it should dress, what colors are allowed and so on. An absolute fashionista!


#### Python is a wizard
Not only can she edit existing books, magazines, images, videos but also create all those things from thin air! 



## Programming from above
I shall use the words coding and programming interchangeably for the purpose of the things described here, they both mean the same.
You can think of each of the afore mentioned folks as very obedient, productive people who only talk their own language. Programming then, is really just learning their language and speaking to them in it. That right there is the majority of programming.
For example, If you want to change the title of your book, you need to speak to Javascript and ask it to do so. Just as you would say to your editor friend "Hey, change the title to 'The Little Lamb'" the same reules apply here. 
Just as `change the title to 'The Little Lamb'` translates into french as `changer le titre en 'Le Petit Agneau'`, it so too translates into Javascript as `document.title = "The Little Lab"` (remember? we said that according to Javascript, all HTML is just a document)
Learn the language, more importantly, its grammar and you can make that cast of characters perform whatever you like!
If you seriously struggle with learning programming, think of each of those instructions as independent lego blocks. Deal with them one at a time. There really isn't more to them.
Perseverance and curiosity are the only two things you need as a begginer programmer. Those two virtues go a long way. No wonder NASA picked them as the perfect words to christen their [Mars rovers](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/body/) with ;) 

## Programmer as a translator
In many ways (but certainly not all) a programmer works like a glorified transaltor. Just as a translator would be handed a bank statement written in French and asked to get it translated to English, so too is the programmer handed a 'Design brief' (written in English) and asked to be translated to Python, Javascript or HTML.
Knowing the meaning of words in French and it's equivalent in English makes a translator valuable. In the same way, taking a design brief and converting it to functional programs, fast loading pages, and beautiful websites is the job of the programmer.
Now, there are three types of programmers - Front end, the folks who design how things look; Back end, the folks who design how things work. Full stack, those who do both.

## Learning to code
#### Learning just in time vs all at once
Just like learning a language requires speaking in that language, so too learning to code requires that you 'speak' in code.
Ie. You need to write code. You need to build stuff.

Once again, just as sitting with a dictionary, learning every word in it is not the best way to learn English, so too rote memorizing ALL function, concept and code snippet will not help you much. You will probably forget all of them before the end of the day.
If you remember how you learnt speaking in English, you'd remember that the best practice was to actually speak in English with your friends, teachers, read books, watch movies and so on. You really need to *indulge* yourself in the language.
While watching a movie you'd come across a perplexing word, then you'd run, find a dictionary and google that word for its meaning, in the process understanding its meaning, use and spelling, all because it made you curious. While learning to program, you should let this very same curiosity guide you. 
Learning concepts just-in-time as a need arises.

#### A case for learning mass blocks at once
Soon you'd learn that its very inefficient and perhaps even irritating to keep looking up these complex words every time an actor uses them. So you get yourself something like Barron's 500 - The 500 most used words in the English language. This helps you greatly. Now, every time you hear a complex word you have some brief idea of what it could mean if not a complete understanding.
The same stands true for learning concepts in programming. This what it means to Read The Docs. This is soo common that there's actually a website dedicated for exactly this purpose-- readthedocs.org






## The lingo
#### Functions are deals
Imagine yourself at a fancy restraurant. You like to drink a lot of water. Everytime you need a glass of water the waiter asks you 5 follow up questions. ("Do you want it hot or cold? Sparkling or natural? Coffee or tea instead? How many liters?...") Imagine having to answer those questions EVERY SINGLE TIME you want just a glass of water.
Now say you make a deal with the waiter, answering those questions once and for all. Your deal would sound something like this:

```
Hey, next time I say "get water", do this:
	 Get me a glass of water that is cold;
	 it should be sparkling;
	 get a cup of coffee along with it;
	 serve it immediately;
	 no more questions, thank you;
	 
```
And that's mostly all that a function is. For return, class, etc there's [Seamor Functions](/seamor.md#functions).
Now of course, I wouldn't recommend you ever say "get water" to a waiter. That would be terribly rude but in the world of programming the computer always has your best intention in mind. Let me know what you think? is it okay to be rude and direct with computers or should we include a please with every function?


#### Scope

The same word can mean different thing in different languages. The English word ”gift” means ”poison” in German and Norwegian, and ”married” in Swedish. As you can see, while the word sounds and is spelled the same, it's meaning is defined by the context (laguage or country) it is used in. It's scope in which a variable is used.
Global scope would mean the united nations coming together and agreeing that that water means water. Then, no matter what part of the world you may go to, everyone will quench your thirst when you ask them for water.
In the same way, if a word is only understood in the current language or contry you're in, then we would say that it has "local scope" since it is relevant and known only locally.
