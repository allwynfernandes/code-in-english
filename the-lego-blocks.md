#### Coding is like texting a buddy.
Progamming is like chatting with a very obedient, smart person. Whatever you ask them to do, they will do. If they can't (for whatever reason) they'll generally reply with a "sorry no cant do" along with some helpful excuses.


#### Javascript is a monk
Javascript is a monk (or a famous non-fiction author). She writes, edits, elaborate books and documents(HTML) on specific request. You may take her help from time to time but not always.

#### HTML is a newspaper
HTML is a document itself. Like a book, bank statement, shopping reciept.

#### CSS is a fashion magazine
Think of CSS as a stone tablet like the 10 commandments. The great creator(You) has written a set of rules in it that prescribe what HTML should and should not wear, how it should dress, what colors are allowed and so on. An absolute fashionista!


#### Python is a wizard
Not only can she edit existing books, magazines, images, videos but also create all those things from thin air! 

#### Functions are deals
Imagine yourself at a fancy restraurant. You like to drink a lot of water. Everytime you need a glass of water the waiter asks you 5 follow up questions. ("Do you want it hot or cold? Sparkling or natural? Coffee or tea instead? How many liters?...") Imagine having to answer those questions EVERY SINGLE TIME you want just a glass of water.
Now say you made a deal with the waiter answering those questions once and for all. Your deal would sound something like this:

```
Hey, next time I say "get water", do this:
	 Get me a glass of water that is cold;
	 it should be sparkling;
	 get a cup of coffee along with it;
	 serve it immediately;
	 no more questions, thank you;
	 
```

Of course, I wouldn't recommend you ever say "get water" to a waiter. That would be terribly rude but in the world of programming the computer always has your best intention in mind. Let me know what you think? is it okay to be rude and direct with computers or should we include a please with every function?


#### Scope
![cafune - Courtesy: 29 Untranslatable Love Words From Around The World](/static/scope-love-word.jpg)
The same word can mean different thing in different languages. The English word ”gift” means ”poison” in German and Norwegian, and ”married” in Swedish. As you can see, while the word sounds and is spelled the same, it's meaning is defined by the context (laguage or country) it is used in. It's scope in which a variable is used.
Global scope would mean the united nations coming together and agreeing that that water means water. Then, no matter what part of the world you may go to, everyone will quench your thirst when you ask them for water.
In the same way, if a word is only understood in the current language or contry you're in, then we would say that it has "local scope" since it is relevant and known only locally.
